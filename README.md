# Vortex
![controllers](documentation/vortex_controllers.JPG)

Vortex is a multi modal computer music system by [Mads Kjeldgaard](https://madskjeldgaard.dk).

It is inspired by reel to reel tape recorders, cybernetic and feedback music as well as more contemporary generative systems.

At it's core it has a complex web of sound processes divided in voices, all of them interconnected in feedback paths and outputting their sound to digital looping varispeed tape reels.

The name is meant to illustrate the fact that there is a continuous, turbulent flow and that the sounds and movements of the performer disappear in this fluid motion.

## About this repository

For now, this repository is mostly for documentation purposes and for anyone else to be inspired by.

That said, it is a work in progress and designed specifically for the author's own work flow so please don't expect any support if you mess around with it yourself (but please go ahead and do so). It is organized as a SuperCollider Quark, making it easy to install.
